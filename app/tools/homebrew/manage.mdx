# Homebrew Package Management

## How to check dependencies of a Homebrew package

To see the dependencies of a Homebrew package, use:

```bash
brew deps <package-name>
```

To see which packages depend on a specific package (reverse dependencies), use:

```bash
brew uses --installed <package-name>
```

This helps you understand what will be affected if you uninstall a package.
